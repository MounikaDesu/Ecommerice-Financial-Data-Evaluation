# Ecommerce-Financial-Data-Evaluation

## Overview
This project involved gaining a comprehensive understanding of Power BI, including its interface, data importing capabilities, and the various visualizations available. The aim was to utilize Power BI to analyze ecommerce data effectively.

## Data Cleaning
We performed several operations to prepare the data, including filtering, cleaning, standardizing, and transforming the data using Power Editor. This ensured that the dataset was accurate and ready for analysis.

## Filtering
To meet the specific needs of different audiences, we tailored the data by applying effective filters, slicing, and dicing techniques. We provided appropriate widgets to focus on specific regions, time periods, or other relevant factors, ensuring that the data presented was relevant and actionable.

## Data Comparison
By leveraging Power Query and Power Editor, we applied merge queries, append queries, and used group by/split columns techniques. This allowed us to make meaningful connections and integrate multiple datasets for a comprehensive analysis.

## Predictive Analytics
The true strength of this dashboard lies in its ability to generate various relationships in Power BI, connect multiple datasets, and uncover hidden trends and correlations. This feature enables businesses to drive growth and make informed, data-backed decisions.

## DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) in Power BI
We utilized DAX to perform complex data analysis and calculations, which helped in building insightful reports and dashboards. DAX is a powerful tool in Power BI that enhances the analytical capabilities of the platform.
